              <p class="govuk-body">In this setting, we help children build their capability to be resilient, confident and to have self-efficacy by observing and planning to meet their individual needs.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">This helps you, the practitioner, offer activities which are challenging enough that the children do not easily get bored, but are also not so challenging that they give up quickly.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">Self-efficacy is the measure of whether a child feels they can succeed and it’s important to understand how best to help them achieve this.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">Remember to regularly praise the child’s efforts.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">For example, if a child is trying to cut up their food, but finding it difficult, you might say “Well done for trying so hard to cut up your meal”. You can then help them by suggesting another way they could try to do it, rather than cutting it up for them.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">This encourages them to build their self-efficacy and to keep trying when faced with difficult tasks.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">It also makes a real difference to praise their process, not just the outcome.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">A way in which to do this could be asking how they decided to build the tower, and saying “I can see you kept trying different solutions when the tower was wobbling” and not just saying when they complete this that the tower looks good.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">You should also give children appropriate responsibility once they are moving around independently. This includes tidying up and taking care of personal belongings.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">Around age 2, ask them to help clean up spills or look after pets. And when they’re closer to age 3, involve them in preparing food and scraping their own plates.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">These responsibilities make the children feel valued and important, in turn building their confidence.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">Also encourage the children to be more independent.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">For example, you may ask them to put on their own coats before going outside.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">At first, fasten the coats for them but then, over time, reduce the help you give them until they can put on their coat, slot the zip in place, and do it up themselves.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">By offering lots of praise for their efforts, this helps the children become more confident when taking on other difficult tasks.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">You should aim to provide opportunities for children to carry out activities that may be considered ‘risky’ such as using knives during cookery activities.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">This is possible by using thorough risk assessments that consider all aspects of the activity and offer safe guidelines and procedures to follow. This ensures that risks are minimised and that children can experience activities and equipment that reflect real life.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">Make sure to explain the potential risks to the children, as this supports them to understand the potential consequences of their choices and actions, and will ensure that they can make informed decisions during future activities.</p>
