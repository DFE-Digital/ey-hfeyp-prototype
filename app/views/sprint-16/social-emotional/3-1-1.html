          <p class="govuk-body">Your role as a practitioner is to help children become self-aware, confident communicators, who are curious to try new things and able to build positive relationships with others.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Over the next few pages we will take a closer look at the expected milestones for personal, social and emotional development between birth and the age of 5.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">As always, it is important to remember that while we will discuss the expected milestones of development, every child will develop at their own rate. No child should be considered as low ability in comparison to these milestones. Some children may require additional support to reduce gaps in learning that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and every child should be supported to achieve their full potential.</p>
