					We’ve added a few things since you were last here. 
				  </div>

				<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Videos</h2>

				<p>We’ve added videos to modules 1, 2 and 3. These videos will enhance your understanding of a specific area of child development and how it applies to your practice. Each video has captions and a transcript. You can look out for these videos as you go through the training. </p>

					<p class="govuk-body" style="padding-left:30px!important">You should provide activities that require children to share of resources and take turns. This will help them to develop to promote problem solving and cooperation skills. </p>

				<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reflection points</h2>
				<p>We’ve replaced practitioner prompts with reflection points. This is  a chance to reflect on what you’ve learned and how it applies to your practice. </p>

					<p class="govuk-body">Reflect on what you have read about supporting children’s individual development.

					<p class="govuk-body">Consider the following questions:</p>
					<ul style="padding-left:70px!important; padding-right:20px;"class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
					  <li>What information do you gather to understand each child’s starting point? </li>
					  <li>Who do you involve?  </li>

					</ul>

					<p>You now have a space to make notes on reflection points. You can view all your notes in your personal learning log. You can access your learning log from the main menu and from any page where the learning log appears. </p>
