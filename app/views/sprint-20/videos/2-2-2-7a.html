            Theory in practice: scaffolding
          </h1>

          <p class="govuk-body">Both Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development (ZPD) and Bruner’s spiral curriculum acknowledge scaffolding. This is where children’s learning is supported and guided by a more knowledgeable other (MKO) to support understanding.</p>


       
  
          <p class="govuk-body">Within scaffolding, the MKO can be a parent, carer, practitioner or peer. At first, the support given may be intensive with lots of direction. Next the child will attempt the task with less support and the MKO might use questioning or visual aids as guidance.  </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">The MKO continues to gradually withdraw the support techniques until the child has acquired the knowledge and skills to complete the task alone.</p>
          
          <p class="govuk-body">Scaffolding techniques can include:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>modelling</li>
            <li>providing examples</li>
            <li>working one-on-one with children</li>
            <li>using visual aids</li>
            <li>use of questioning</li>
            <li>using prior knowledge</li>
            <li>chunking knowledge to make it achievable</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">Bandura’s social learning theory and concept of self efficacy can also be considered. When children are observing the MKO they are learning from their behaviours and communication. When practitioners successfully scaffold children’s learning, they are supporting children to master new skills and develop their own self efficacy.</p>
