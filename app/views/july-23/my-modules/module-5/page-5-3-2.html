    </h1><div class="gem-c-govspeak"><p>The physical environment of your setting should support you in your role. The routine, resources and activities should include lots of opportunities for children to experience and develop different physical skills.</p>
    
    <p>When planning your environment, you should also consider the characteristics of effective teaching and learning as identified in the statutory framework for the early years foundation stage (EYFS).</p>
    
    <p>These characteristics are:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>playing and exploring - children investigate and experience things, and ‘have a go’</li>
      <li>active learning - children concentrate and keep on trying if they encounter difficulties, and enjoy achievements</li>
      <li>creating and thinking critically - children have and develop their own ideas, make links between ideas, and develop strategies for doing things</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>This topic includes:</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Adult led activity</li>
      <li>Child led activity</li>
      <li>Meeting individual needs</li>
      <li>Inclusive practice</li>
      <li>Managing risk</li>
      <li>The outdoor environment</li>
