            <p>On average, adults require 2,000 to 2,500 calories a day (usually called kcals on food packaging). Children aged 5 and under need on average between 750 and 1,400 calories.</p>

            <p>A handy tip to remember what children need each day is 5-5-3-2:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">five</span> portions of fruit and veg – although the more the better </li>
                <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">five</span> portions of carbohydrates </li>
                <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">three</span> portions of dairy or plant-based alternatives</li>
                <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">two</span> portions of protein </li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is just a guideline. Children should feel able to indicate when they are full or still hungry.</p>

            <p>Foods and drinks high in fat, salt and sugars, like cakes, pastries, biscuits, chocolate, crisps, fried foods and fizzy drinks, should only be consumed occasionally. It’s best to offer water or milk to drink, and avoid offering smoothies and fruit juices as these are full of fruit sugars. </p>

            <p>A popular resource for a healthy and balanced diet is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide">The Eatwell Guide</a>. This shows what a healthy plate should look like in one day. But this plate was created for adults and school children and doesn’t strictly apply to children aged 5 and under.</p>

            <h2>Portion size for children aged 5 and under</h2> 

            <p>A portion size for a child aged 5 and under is generally smaller than an adult portion.</p>  
            
            <p>The portion size should be in proportion to a child's body size and appetite. Portion size for a toddler may be roughly the size of their clenched fist for a main meal and half a piece of fruit or a tablespoon of vegetables for a snack.</p>  
            
            <p>Monitor a child's appetite and adjust portion sizes to make sure they get enough nutrients. You should avoid particularly large portions (they can always ask for more) and encourage children to stop eating when they feel full. </p>

            <h2>Allergies</h2> 

            <p>Food allergies develop when the body’s immune system recognises the food proteins as invaders and releases chemicals to attack.</p>
            <p>Allergies to foods can cause serious reactions. These include hives, nausea, closing of the breathing passages, a sudden drop in blood pressure and even death in the most severe cases.</p>
            <p>The most common food allergies in the UK are eggs, milk and nuts, but there are many others. </p>

            <p>You must find out if a child has any allergies before they are admitted into your setting. As children may be trying some foods for the first time in your setting you must know how to recognise the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction. If you suspect that child has a food allergy, encourage parents or carers to seek advice and diagnosis from a doctor.</p>
            <p>To avoid mixing foods that are safe with those that cause allergic reactions, always think about food allergies when the food is being delivered, sorted, prepared and cooked. Make sure that parents, early years practitioners and kitchen staff are all communicating with each other about food allergies and sharing information about which children have which allergies.</p>

            <p><b>Tips to stay safe include:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>label foods clearly with their content</li>
                <li>have separate cupboards for similar items, for example, gluten free flour and regular flour </li>
                <li>avoid cross-contamination by:
                    <ol>
                        <li>washing hands</li>
                        <li>using colour-coded equipment and utensils, for example labelling a child’s cup with their name if they have milk allergies</li>
                        <li>having separate preparation areas for foods that are allergens</li>
                        <li>have rules for visitors around bringing food in to your setting</li>
                    </ol>
