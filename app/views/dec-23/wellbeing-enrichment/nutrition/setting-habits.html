            <p>Setting good eating habits for children right from the start is essential. If they learn this at an early age, they are more likely to keep these good habits as they grow up.</p>
            <p>Good nutrition is important for children aged 5 and under to ensure they:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>get the right amount of energy (calories) and nutrients they need while they are growing rapidly</li>
                <li>don’t consume too much energy (calories), which may cause them to become overweight or obese</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Introducing a balanced diet and good eating habits at a young age encourages children to eat a variety of foods which contain essential nutrients. These are especially important during this time of early growth and development.</p>
            <p>This is a crucial time to help to reduce health inequalities throughout a child’s life. Too many children do not get the healthy foods they need to thrive. Your setting can influence these children’s food choices whelping them develop a good relationship with food.</p>

           <h2>What is a healthy, balanced diet?</h2>
            <p>A healthy diet is based on the four food groups:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>fruits and vegetables </li>
                <li>milk and dairy products and plant-based alternatives</li>
                <li>starchy carbohydrates such as grains and cereals</li>
                <li>meat and fish, meat alternatives, beans and pulses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Encourage children to try and eat a wide variety of foods. When children eat together  this encourages them to try different foods that they might not try at home. For example, children who won’t touch broccoli at home will happily try some if they see their peers eating it.</p>
            <p>For children aged 5 and under, plan meals and snacks that include a variety of food and drinks from the four food groups every day. The more new foods they try from the four food groups, the wider the range of nutrients children will get from their meals.</p>

            <h2>Weaning and how to support it </h2>

            <p>Weaning is a gradual process of moving a baby from milk to solid foods. This takes place from 6 months, when government guidance says that milk alone is no longer enough to meet a baby’s nutritional needs. This is sometimes called complementary feeding as the baby will still need milk or infant formula milk.  Weaning starts only once a baby can stay in a sitting position. They should be able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>support their own head</li>
                <li>use their hands, eyes and mouth,</li>
                <li>swallow their food</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Weaning helps a baby learn new skills such as chewing and biting and introduces new textures to them.</p>
            <p>You should reach agreement with parents or carers about when and how to start weaning.</p>

            <h2>First foods to introduce</h2>

            <p>Baby’s first food could be a simple vegetable or fruit puree. This can help a baby get used to new tastes and textures before going on to develop an interest in solid foods. At the same time, they are also getting used to moving foods around their mouths and swallowing them. </p> 

            <p>Once babies are comfortable with puree, feed them the same type of food with added texture. This could be mashed fruit or vegetables, like bananas or avocado. Its a good idea to offer savoury as well as sweet foods, so babies get used to a range of tastes.</p>

            <p>Encourage babies to feed themselves with finger foods, such as a soft, cooked carrot stick or a piece of avocado. This can help them develop hand-eye coordination and motor skills.</p>

            <h2>The importance of different textures</h2> 

            <p>Introducing different textures to a child's diet when weaning is essential. It helps them learn to chew and swallow properly and encourages mouth and muscle development. It also helps them to get used to different textures, which means they will be less likely to become fussy eaters.</p>

            <p>Children who are given a variety of textures from an early age recognise a bigger range of flavours. They are more likely to accept a bigger selection of food textures as they grow up and are less likely to be upset by textures or develop sensory issues with food.</p>  

            <p>Different textures can also improve the way nutrients are absorbed, helping a child’s gut to function well.</p>

            <h2>How to introduce different textures</h2>

            <p>To introduce different food textures to a child, gradually make purees thicker and add lumpy or mashed foods. Foods such as soft cheeses, porridge oats and cooked potato or sweet potato can be introduced for thicker, smoother textures which can help develop muscles in the mouth.</p> 

            <p>You can also try finger foods which are easy to grab and hold, such as slices of cucumber or melon . These can encourage a baby's hand-eye coordination, as well as introducing new textures.</p>   

            <p>Try using food as a sensory activity. Let babies touch food with their hands and play with textures, like portions of cooked spaghetti.</p>

            <h2>Cutting food safely when weaning</h2> 

            <p>When cutting food for weaning, make sure the size is manageable to avoid choking.</p>  

            <p>Cut food into small, bite-sized pieces that can easily fit into a baby's mouth.  Cut large fruits like melon and firm fruits like apple into slices instead of small chunks. Food should be firm enough to grasp, so it won't get stuck in a baby’s throat. Finger-shaped food (like soft, well-cooked vegetables or fruits that are easy to hold) is ideal for babies.</p>  

            <p>Foods that are a good choice for weaning include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>apple slices</li>
                <li>cucumber sticks</li>
                <li>carrot sticks</li>
                <li>soft cheese</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Cut small fruits lengthways and then half again (quarters).  These fruits include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>grapes</li>
                <li>raspberries</li>
                <li>strawberries</li>
                <li>cherry tomatoes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Avoid foods like popcorn or whole nuts, which are all choking hazards.</h3> 

            <p>Always supervise babies closely when they are eating.</p>

            <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Building healthy eating habits for children starts with weaning.</li>
                <li>Introducing a balance of nutrients and a variety of tastes and textures right from the start will mean that children will have all the essential nutrients for their growth and development.</li>
                <li>Good early eating habits will also ensure good habits later in life and help to reduce health inequalities.</li>
