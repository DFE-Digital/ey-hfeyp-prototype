            A balanced approach to learning: child led play

          <p class="govuk-body">There are extensive benefits associated with both child led and adult led activity in an early years setting. The key is to use your professional judgement and child development knowledge to strike the correct balance to ensure the benefits are maximised for each child.</p>

              <p>“Children need opportunities to develop their own play and independent exploration. This is enjoyable and motivating. They also need adults to ‘scaffold’ their learning by giving them just enough help to achieve something they could not do independently.”</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">There are many benefits to child led play.  </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Imagination and creativity </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">When a child has chosen the activity, task or experience they will often feel in control of its outcome. Where the activity does not involve adult interaction, children will often feel more freedom to trial new ideas without any expectation. This often leads to increased imagination and creativity. The chosen activities are also not necessarily reality bound allowing children the freedom to test out ideas or process thoughts. </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Increased concentration </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">Often children will become fully immersed in activities and tasks they have initiated themselves as they are likely to be built upon their interests or something that has encouraged their curiosity. This can lead to longer periods of engagement and deeper understanding of a topic. </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Increased communication</h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">A child will often feel more confident within an activity or task they have instigated themselves. The activity is also more likely to be based on an interest in which they are more knowledgeable. These factors will often result in increased conversation, activity commentary and spontaneous comment.   </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Independence </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">When a child feels completely at ease they are more likely to attempt an activity or task independently without worrying about the outcome. This often leads to the development or improvement of new skills and knowledge resulting in increased independence.    </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Emotional development  </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">Children can use these opportunities to explore their feelings through imaginative play such as role play opportunities. Imaginative play gives them the freedom to experiment and explore while keeping full control over the outcomes.   </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Social development  </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">Children can use these opportunities to navigate social skills such as sharing, turn taking and negotiating the views of others with minimal intervention from practitioners. This can successfully support children to develop deeper understanding and encourage them to test and practice new skills. </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">We can learn a lot about a child’s health, wellbeing and development from watching them during child led activity as they feel empowered to express themselves freely.  </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Limitations of child led activity </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">There are, of course, also limitations to child led activity. Children will often, if not always, lean towards their preferred activities and interests and often use skills they already feel confident in.  </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">If left to only participate in child led play, over prolonged periods, gaps in learning and development may open or widen.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Limited adult led activity and formative assessment opportunities will also cause delays in identifying and supporting these gaps.</p>

						  <li>How do you plan your curriculum to provide an appropriate balance of adult led and child led activities?  </li>
						  <li>How do you make sure children have free access to books, toys and creative materials to encourage independent choice?  </li>
						  <li>How do the adult-led and child-led activities you plan impact on the children’s learning, development and behaviour? </li>
