<p>It is important that you plan your curriculum, practice and environment to enable ambitious physical development for every child.</p>

<p>Your curriculum will set out what you want children to learn, know and be able to do. This must cover the 7 areas of learning in the EYFS. When planning and delivering the curriculum you should consider how the different areas support and underpin all learning, especially physical development and the other 2 prime areas - communication and language and personal, social and emotional development.</p>

<p>Your practice is how you will deliver the curriculum and help children learn what you want them to learn. You will need to use observation and assessment of children to adapt your practice to suit the starting points and needs of each child. This is important to give them as many opportunities as possible to develop their physical abilities, skills and confidence.</p>

<p>One of the many ways you can support children to learn, develop and thrive is through adult led activities and experiences. Children learn from interactions with their peers, during child led play and from their environment. There are however lots of skills, knowledge, vocabulary and much more, that children need an engaged adult to help them learn. Sometimes this is via adult led activities, sometimes it will be by an adult guiding or responding to children to extend learning.</p>

<p>Adult led activities can also introduce new skills. For example, showing children how to hold and use cutlery or crayons, or showing children how to use a pair of scissors to make sure they can use them effectively.</p>

<p>Children will need to hear the language associated with their physical movements. For example, how will a child know what a ‘pivot’ is, if they have never been shown what it looks like or heard the word pivot used in combination with the movement?</p>

<p>Adult led opportunities will help you to shape children’s actions to support their development. While these opportunities do occur during child led activity, it is important to be intentional about helping children learn certain things, rather than waiting until they arise organically. Adult led activity helps you to target the gaps you have identified between a child’s starting point and their expected stage of development.</p>

<p>After children have observed your skills or followed your guidance, they will need to test their new knowledge through imitation and practice. You can help them do this by making sure that they can access areas and activities that support the development of physical skills throughout the day.</p>
